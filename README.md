# San Andreas Definitive Edition Multiplayer 

## Introduction

TRILOGY:MP is an unofficial free modification for GTA: The Trilogy — The Definitive Edition that adds multiplayer to the game.
The project is based on code injection and hooking techniques. It adds functions such as a scripting API, networking, multiplayer, and the extension of in-game limitations.
Unfortunately, the project could not be completed due to lack of time. This project's code is entirely selfmade reverse-engineered.

The project is divided into the following components:
- `client/`
- `server/`
- `shared/`
- `ui/`
